The "PROMETHEUS_D_6_2_QW_two_section_Laser_Simulation.m" script simulates the behavior of a two-section gain saturable absorber quantum well laser. Specifically, it analyzes the laserâ€™s spiking dynamics under various critical parameters, including the bias current (I_bias), the reverse bias voltage of the absorber (V_rev), the cavity length (L), and the ratio of the saturable absorber section to the total cavity length (R_abs). The scanning range for each parameter can be customized by the user through the XX_start, XX_step, and XX_end parameters, where XX represents the respective parameter name.

The script computes key output metrics, including the mean peak power, mean pulse repetition frequency, and mean full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the generated spikes after 20 ns, which is considered the necessary stabilization time for the laser.

The laser model is based on a set of three rate equations that describe the evolution of the carrier density in the gain section (Ng), carrier density in the absorber section (Nabs), and photon number within the laser cavity (Nph). The integration method employed is the exponential integrator. Additional parameters and their descriptions are provided within the code.
