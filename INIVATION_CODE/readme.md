## Project Structure

‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ `classify.py`
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ `create_event_data.py`

### Breakdown of each file

* `classify.py` : Dataset Preview & Classification
    1. Merges the dataset for 12um, 16um and 20um PMMA Particles
    2. Creates a balanced dataset by maintaining an equal number of samples for each class.
    3. Shows a preview of the dataset, to ensure its integrity (if needed)
    4. Develops SNN and LeNet-5 networks to classify PMMA particles.
    
* `create_event_data.py` : Dataset extraction from Inivation raw data event stream
    1. Prompts the user for the configuration (integration window, thresholds, input file).
    2. Receives events in batches every `integration_window` Œºs.
    3. Filters the incoming events based on low and high threshold.
    4. The filtered events are saved in an array of shape `(X, Y, T, P)`, where:

        - `X, Y` are constrained within a **150 √ó 150** bounding box window.  
        - `T` represents the timesteps, incremented each time a frame is found between the **low** and **high** thresholds.  
        - `P` denotes the polarity, indicating an increase or decrease in pixel brightness.
