def classification(X, y, alpha=0.01, train_ratio=0.3):
    """
    Perform classification using Ridge regression.

    This function splits the data into training and testing sets,
    fits a Ridge regression model to the training data, and evaluates it on the test set.

    Parameters:
        X (ndarray): Feature matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features).
        y (ndarray): Target vector of shape (n_samples,).
        alpha (float): Regularization strength for Ridge regression. Smaller values imply less regularization.
        train_ratio (float): Fraction of data to use for training (e.g., 0.3 = 30% train / 70% test).

    Returns:
        tuple:
            y_test (ndarray): True labels of the test set.
            y_test_predict (ndarray): Predicted labels of the test set.
            coefficients (ndarray): Learned weights (including bias) from Ridge regression.
            sigma (ndarray): Placeholder for standard deviation of weights (unused, returned as zeros).
